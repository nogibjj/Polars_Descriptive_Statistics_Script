# Structure for this project 

This project serves as an introduction to polars, this project is a recreation of my [Individual Project 1](https://github.com/nogibjj/Meron_Gedrago_individual1) with polars. Similarly to the individual project, we use polars to read and describe the data, as well as use matplotlib to visualize the data. Find below the structure of the project

# Assignment Requirements

Python script using Polars for descriptive statistics
Read a dataset (CSV or Excel)
Generate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
Create at least one data visualization

# Data Set Used in this Project
The data set used in this project, women-stem.csv, was pulled from FiveThirtyEight git repository, an organization offering public data. This data shows the current situation of women in stem majors, including majors, the share of women over total student population, median of income after graduation, etc.
