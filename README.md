# Structure for this project 

This project serves as an introduction to polars, this project is a recreation of my [Individual Project 1](https://github.com/nogibjj/Meron_Gedrago_individual1) with polars. Similarly to the individual project, we use polars to read and describe the data, as well as use matplotlib to visualize the data. Find below the structure of the project

Read a dataset (CSV or Excel)
Generate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
Create at least one data visualization

# Data Set Used in this Project
The data set used in this project was pulled from kaggle.com. This data is described as a "comprehensive overview of various factors affecting student performance in exams", including data for 6,607 students's grade and information on various factors that may affect their exam performance, such as # of hours studied, percentage of classes attended, parental involvement (Low, Medium, High), and etc.
